# Stereo-Reconstruction
This project was done as the part of the course CIS580 : Machine Perception. In this project, 3D reconstruction from multiple images was done using two different algorithms :- Two-view stereo and Multi-view stereo algorithms.
In two-view stereo algorithm, firstly, the images were rectified. Then the disparity map was created by matching the patches in the images using three different distance metric kernels - ssd, sad and zncc. Then, from the disparity map, we obtained the depth map which in turn gave us the pointcloud.
In the multiview stereo algorithm, we sweep imaginary depth planes (fronto-parallel) across a range of candidate depths and then we project the neighboring views onto an imaginary depth plane and back onto the reference view using homography. Then we produce a cost/similarity map between the reference view and warped neighboring view using patches similar to the previous algorithm. Then we construct a cost volume by stacking the depth cost maps and then take the argmax of the costs across the depths at each pixel to output the depth map.
